# Intro

> More and more people value the word 'healing' in today's busy modern society. There is a growing trend to provide various contents to tired people in modern society, including the word ‘healing’, such as ‘healing’ concert, ‘healing’ talk show, ‘healing’ camp, etc.
> Based on this phenomenon, people in modern society thought that there are more people who value time to take care of themselves by doing “healing” and want to be comforted.
> Based on the definition of a diary above, people can write their candid feelings or records about their day in a diary. Therefore, the basic idea was that the homeroom teacher would leave a comment when you write your childhood diary based on the diary and submit it.

> To solve the problems we defined, our team IT23 came up with a diary app for adults who want to relive the emotions of keeping a diary when they were young.
